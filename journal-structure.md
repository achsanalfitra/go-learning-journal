# Structures of this study journal

---

This is a document reference for this journal. This serves as a canvas for brainstorming. It is assumed that there is only one main.go file in here. Therefore, everything else belong to packages that can be run independently. A document to handle the documentation for each package exist, accomodating easier understanding.  

Running the code file helps understanding how each code work. However, the proper documentation is given through the document given alongside the code file.  

Here is the list of materials:  

## Structures from root level

* Basic Go Syntax
* Data Structures
* Algorithms
* Advanced Go (coming soon)
